Derby City Food
===============

A text messaging application built with PHP, MySQL and [SMSified](http://smsified.com).

Powered by open data from the [City of Louisville, KY](http://data.louisvilleky.gov/).

How Does it Work?
=================

Just sent a text message with the name (or part of the name) of the establishment serving food to an SMSified number. You'll get back details on the latest health inspection.

Note - this app is very beta, and is not affiliated in any way with Louisville Metro government.
